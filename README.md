## 🧠 Overview
**AI Mood Companion** is an interactive Python-based application developed as part of the **AI Bootcamp at Shaqra University**, in collaboration with the **Google Developer Student Club (GDSC)**.  

The project uses **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze and track users’ emotional states through their written reflections.  
It encourages self-awareness, provides motivational responses, and visualizes emotional trends over time.

---

## 🚀 Objectives
- Apply **NLP and AI concepts** learned during the bootcamp.  
- Build a tool that helps users reflect on their emotions.  
- Visualize emotional data for insight and personal growth.  
- Demonstrate practical implementation of AI using **Python**.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🧩 Real-time **sentiment analysis** (positive / neutral / negative).  
- 🗂️ Automatic **logging** of user input into a CSV file.  
- 📊 Visual **charts and trend analysis** for emotional tracking.  
- 🤖 Friendly **chatbot** offering motivational advice.  
- 💻 Easy to run on **Google Colab** or locally.  
- 🧮 Built-in commands for quick stats and data review.
